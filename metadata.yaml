# +++ AGENT +++
#
# Agent entities are used for many fields below and can be either a person, an organisation or a combination of both.
# The minimum requirement is either a persons family name, an organisation name or any of the identifiers for them.
#
# An agent combines the following fields for a person with fields for an organisation:
#
# PERSON fields
#   orcid: ORCID person ID, https://orcid.org  example: 0000-0001-9745-636X
#   family: last name
#   given: first name
# ORGANISATION fields
#   rorid: ROR organisation ID, https://ror.org  example: https://ror.org/05fjyn938
#   organisation: name of the organisation / institution
#   department: subunit within the organisation, sometimes a project
#   city: city
#   state: state or province
#   country: ISO 2 letter country code
# SHARED fields
#   email: email address
#   url: webpage
#   note: miscellaneous extra information, used for contributor roles
#
# In case no parsed agent can be provided it is permitted to supply a list of simple strings which will then be parsed.
# For the parsing to given and family name to correctly work it is highly recommended to use one of the following formats:
# GivenName FamilyName: Only use this in case the last name is a single token. There can be many first names e.g. John Paul Sartre
# FamilyName, GivenName: Supports any conmplex last name. E.g. Brinch Hansen, Per
